## GOAL OF PROJECT : THE GOAL OF THE YOGA POSE RECOGNITION PROJECT IS TO DEVELOP A ROBUST AND ACCURATE SYSTEM CAPABLE OF IDENTIFYING AND CLASSIFYING DIFFERENT YOGA POSES IN REAL-TIME USING MEDIAPIPE'S POSE ESTIMATION CAPABILITIES.

## TASK: RECOGNITION

## DATASET SUMMARY:

**This dataset is all about computer vision tasks in the new method media pipe approach**.
